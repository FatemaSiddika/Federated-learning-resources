### PySyft
> Syft is an open-source framework developed by OpenMined that provides tools for privacy-preserving machine learning. It is designed to facilitate Federated Learning (FL), where data remains on the client devices and only the model updates are shared with the central server. Syft allows you to implement various privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy, secure multi-party computation (SMPC), and homomorphic encryption.
